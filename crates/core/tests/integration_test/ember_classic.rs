//! End-to-end smoke test for the Ember.js / Glimmer / Embroider plugin
//! against the `tests/fixtures/ember-classic/` fixture.
//!
//! Covers the plugin's three suppression mechanisms — at the level of
//! `AnalysisResults`, not the per-shape unit tests in
//! `crates/core/src/plugins/ember.rs`:
//!
//! 1. `tooling_dependencies` — `ember-source`, `ember-cli-htmlbars`, and
//!    other runtime-resolved packages are not flagged as `unused-dependency`
//!    even though no source file imports them.
//! 2. `virtual_module_prefixes` — `@ember/object`,
//!    `@ember/routing/router-service`, and `@ember/service` (AMD-loader /
//!    Embroider-rewritten specifiers; not real npm packages) are not
//!    flagged as `unresolved-import` or `unlisted-dependency`.
//! 3. `generated_import_substrings` — `{{rootURL}}` and
//!    `{{config.assetsPath}}` placeholders extracted from `app/index.html`
//!    are not flagged as `unresolved-import`.
//!
//! Also fences:
//!
//! - `used_class_member_rules` — `Service::init` / `Service::willDestroy`
//!   and `Route::model` / `Route::setupController` are not surfaced as
//!   `unused-class-member` on the convention subclasses.
//! - Template-only imports survive — `on` in `app/components/counter.gts`
//!   is referenced only inside the `<template>` block.
